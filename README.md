# ChoiceScript Stat Modifier

In order to use this, do the following: 
1. Navigate to the story of your choice. 
     - Navigate to the actual game, after the "Play the game" options. We want the stats to be loaded in memory. 
2. Open your developer console (for example: ctrl+shift+J)
3. Copy the entire script in opener.js
4. Paste into the console
5. Press Enter. 

This should open a window that contains all of the stats, along with sliders to modify those values. You can specify min-max values for the sliders (for example, 
money often can be higher than 100). 

*Note that in order for values to be saved, you can't be on the stats screen and you need to navigate to the next scene. Don't make a change, move to the stat screen, 
then move back because the game won't save your values. 

I've tested in Opera GX and Chrome on Windows 11.
